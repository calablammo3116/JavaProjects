// Exam will NOT feature any print statements. We will be being asked to return 
// things, NOT print them out. For methods, know whether a variable is passed by value 
// or passed by reference. The easiest way to determine whether a variable is pass by 
// value or pass by reference is this: primitives are pass by value, objects (like 
// arrays) are pass by reference, the only exception to this is Strings because 
// Strings are immutable.
// Know the Math libraries and Math library functions, including: Math.random(), 
// Math.abs(), Math.pow(), Math.sqrt().
// Also know the String library and STring library functions, including: 
// String.substring() (both of them), String.charAt() (which you are supposed to use 
// for your "Halloween" project), String.trim(), String.equals(), String.compareTo(), 
// String.length(), and String.contains().
// You do NOT have to use Scanner at all. You also don't have to import anything if 
// you are writing the code on paper.
// If doing Math.random(), multiply by the value of the range (e.g. for [0,20), 
// multiply by 21). String.substring()
// The methods that are really heavy on the exam will be these: String.compareTo(), 
// String.length(), Math.random(), and String.substring().
// We will be given one question on a UML diagram, which is the diagram that Professor  
// Dencker draws before making a class. A UML diagram contains the following: 1. the 
// variables (including what they are, e.g. int, String, etc., and their name, e.g. 
// "age", "animalName", etc.), 2. the constructors, and 3. the methods (instance and 
// static).
// We will also be given a question where we have to write an entire class. If you 
// have normal handwriting, then your class should take half of a page to three 
// quarters of a page. It could take more or less depending on how big or small your 
// handwriting is. Making the UML diagram and writing the class will be worth over 
// 25% of the possible points on the test.
// Good practice problems for the exam can be found on codingbat.com. You can find the 
// solutions to these problems by simply Googling, "codingbat solutions," and then 
// finding a website or somebody's GitHub that has it and then reading it. 
// CodingBat also has test cases that you can run your answers against, and if you 
// pass all the test cases, then you have gotten the question correct.
